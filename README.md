### Canon RF 800mm f/11 IS STM Lens

This lens has a tripod mounting foot (of sorts) in the same ring segment as the switches.
As such there are two prototypes for this lens, one that omits the foot mounting entirely,
with the intent that it'll be mounted with dual-sided adhesive tape, and one that tries to 
use the foot mount to hold the lens in place. Note that this will interfere with the mount;
best case is you'll likely need a longer mounting screw, worst case is your camera isn't as
secure on your tripod. All use of these designs is at your own risk.

Another fun aspect of this lens is that the ring segment is not flat, so fit is best-effort.

These lenses are a very similar design; the lens segments are unobstructed by any foot mount 
and have a flat cross-section. Current designs have a fitting for a #4 closure bolt opposite the switch window.
